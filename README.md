# MVGA
Make SOM Voting Great Again! Choose a variety (soon) of themes enabled through userscript. These scripts add some flair to your voting page and also make needed fixes to the page (such as that question mark button on top of orpheus). This should help decrease your OCD reaction...

How to use this app is super simple!

1. Go into the site and choose a theme (lynn89-sudo.github.io/mgva)
2. Copy the code and go into SOM's voting page
3. Open up web console and paste it in
4. Now.. wait nvm you're done!

## Special Thanks to Neon
Thanks to Neon for his SOM Share Votes userscript, which has been integrated into this project and facilitated the existence of this project.
